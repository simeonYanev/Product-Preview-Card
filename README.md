### The challenge

- Replicate the exact design
- Users should be able to see hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![(./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

In this challenge I've learned how to replicate a simple design from a picture using only basic HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

I think that I've successfully copied the desktop version of the disign but still have to work on my responsive design skills.ะต
